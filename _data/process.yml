    title: functional design
    description: After a full site assessment, we develop a functional diagram to
      confirm the layout of key features like entertaining areas, garden beds,
      and pathways. We also create a style guide and mood board to establish a
      consistent theme for your space. This step is crucial to ensure your
      outdoor area flows well, and we work closely with you until you're
      completely satisfied.

    title: construction
    description: If you’d like support through to construction, we can connect you
      with trusted builders in our network who align with the design, budget,
      and level of detail required. Many clients choose this for a smoother
      handover — but you're always free to use your own preferred builder.
