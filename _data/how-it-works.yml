  - step_title: Final Ultra High Definition Rendering
    step_description: In this stage we take the design to the next level by
      rendering realistic images through state-of-the-art software showcasing
      lifelike lighting, realistic materials including dynamic elements like
      water movement and shadows, providing an immersive preview of your
      finished space. This ensures you experience your future landscape in vivid
      detail before it's built, ensuring every element is perfectly aligned with
      your vision.

  - step_title: Construction
    step_description: We ensure a seamless transition by offering a detailed
      handover to one of our trusted partner builders or your builder of choice.
      We provide on-site consultations during the construction phase to ensure
      the build aligns with your approved design. This ensures a smooth process
      and a final outcome that meets your vision.
